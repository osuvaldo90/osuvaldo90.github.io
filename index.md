## Hello!

Call me Osvi. I am a software engineer based in Philadelphia, PA.

What excites me most about software engineering is tackling complex problems and designing practical, elegant solutions to meet specific business needs. I have helped businesses automate processes, expand market reach, and build mission-critical systems that drive real results.
