My name is Osvi and I'm a software engineer based in Philadelphia, PA.

I take a methodical and collaborative approach to problem solving that involves working with the team to truly understand what we're trying to solve and why before jumping into solutions. I believe this brings clarity and conviction during implementation.

Since 2013, I have worked in various industries including healthcare, real estate, and early childhood education and across many technologies from embedded systems to web applications.
