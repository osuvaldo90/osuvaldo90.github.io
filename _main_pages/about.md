🚧 Under Construction

{% comment %}
I first learned about programming when I was 12 years old. My friend Brad showed me he could customize his Xanga profile using HTML, CSS, and JS. I thought that was so cool and it put me down a rabbit hole that I never left. Over the next several years I would learn various programming languages, frameworks, paradigms,
- PHP
- OOP
